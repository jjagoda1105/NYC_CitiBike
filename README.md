# NYC_CitiBike
## Overview
The purpose of this project is to figure out how well the citi bikes will perform if they move the bikes into Des Moines, Iowa. As data analyst, we have explored the data from August 2019 to understand patterns to help predict the success of citi bikes in Des Moines. There are a few graphs explained below that will help us out how we can be the most successful.

## Top Starting Location
Our top starting location is in Manhattan, because it is the most densely populated area of NYC and it allows for easy transportation via bike.

## Stop Hours by Weekday

Bike usage is consistant with rush hour, however we see a dip on Wednesdays for some reason.

### Summary 

During August, there were 2.3 Million rides that were used on CitiBikes with male users being the most popular gender. With that many people using the bikes, it is safe to say that this will be successful. This will help people in Des Moines get to work if they don't have a car, or if they live close. It is shown that most people use the bikes during rush hour, so people will definitely use the bikes during rush hour in Des Moines as well.
